### Re-homed java17-developer-certification to java repository at https://github.com/jamie-burns0/java/tree/main/java17-developer-certification

Code fragments and exercises for preparation to sit Java 17 certification exam.

Quick background. Functioning in tech lead, team lead, business and product owner roles took me away from hands-on coding. Returning to hands-on coding, I found myself 10 versions behind the then Java LTS. I also bought a copy of the __OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-829__ by Selidoff and Boyarsky - https://amzn.asia/d/jl3pWas. This repository are my little code exercises and fragments as i worked throught the study guide.
